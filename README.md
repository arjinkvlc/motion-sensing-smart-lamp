# motion-sensing-smart-lamp
  This project aims to develop a motion-sensitive smart lamp, which is an IoT device. The lamp will be designed to automatically turn on when motion is detected in a room and stay on for a set period of time. This project aims to increase safety, energy saving and user comfort. Users will be notified via the mobile application if a stranger enters their home when they are not at home, and will have the opportunity to take action, thanks to the notification that will be sent to their devices.
